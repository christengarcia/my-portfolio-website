# Christen Garcia Portfolio Website
*For my website I wanted to have a very simplistic design at the same having a page slideshow effect. I chose a combination of colours that are extensions of my personality. The colours are black, blue and grey. I’ve created pages on about me, resume, links to social media and contact me.*

# Inspiration

My first task in the project was to choose base colours for my design and these were black, blue and grey. I collected a lot of pictures in Pinterest and saved many website links that inspired me. The most I liked was the Adobe website in Australia:

The combination of black, blue and grey is basically the clothing colours that I wear on a daily basis. I thought the colour red was a nice contrast from the dark backgrounds so I decided to make my logo red.

# Designs in Figma

I wanted a really simple website design with minimal pictures so I decided that I would need to create a mobile, iPad and desktop version. My site would mostly contain text so making it responsive on the various device sizes would be more consistent.

While I was browsing for inspiration I came across parallax and page piling designs. To  adhere to my plan of a creating a simplistic looking website, I chose to use page piling. Page piling is basically similar to a slideshow so my Figma designs would have fixed single page dimensions.  

I first created a mobile version in Figma and then extended that to iPad and desktop versions. I wanted a different colour for each page but wanted my first page and last page to be black for symmetry. I also wanted to have a traditional look for my resume so I chose a plain white background with black text.

On my social media page I wanted to have some design contrast to the other plain web pages so I decided to have a textured black background with a contrasting white icon links. 

The last thing I did was to create my logo on www.tailorbrands.com 

# Changes / Improvements

Once my Figma designs was finished I started coding. The only major change to my Figma design was to add an extra white page for my resume. Since I was using pagePiling all my resume inputs wasn't able to fit on one page. 

I also decided to make my social media icons glow when you hover over them. Another addition I made from a recommendation from a fellow student was to put a resume download link; I chose a black download icon. 

# Challenges
There were challenges right from the beginning since this was to be my first website to ever create.  The design process for me was easier than the coding. Since my website was going to be simplistic looking, I had to get the combination of colours right in order to have a professional look. 

Google search was my best friend through out the project. My experience with html and css was very limited so about 90% of the time while coding, I was using google to help me. I learnt more from this week than the one month of pre-work before the course. Every step of the way I was learning something new. I’ve never used jQuery before but I had my mind set on using pagePiling effect so I was really motivated to learn and get it to work. 

# Finished Product
I’m really happy with my site. The design is exactly how I wanted it to be.

I'm pleased with the outcome of my portfolio website, it reflects my objectives I originally wanted; simple yet appealing and informative.
